## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By now, I am fairly confident in my HTML and CSS skills. I have been using these technologies for years now and can say for certain that I can build projects from scratch. That being said there are still things that I do not know and have learned by building this simple project. They are the following:

- < picture > tag: In the image section of this project, the source has to be changed based on screen size. For that, I used the picture tag and specified the images that I need to use for mobile and desktop.
- It is also my first time using hsl values for colors. They are certainly new for me and I'm looking forward to using them again in the future.
- perspective and overflow properties: I'm looking forward to learning more about these properties.


### Continued development

I am excited to learn different HTML tags and CSS properties that are not commonly used in my future projects. Hopefully by doing more projects like this, I'll get exposed to new ones!
